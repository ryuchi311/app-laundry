# Bulk SMS Marketing - Active Customer Filter Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented a feature to exclude inactive customers from Bulk SMS Marketing campaigns. The system now only sends bulk SMS messages to customers who have `is_active = True` in their customer record.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes (`app/sms_settings.py`)

#### Updated `bulk_message()` function:
- **Line 202-205**: Modified customer query to filter only active customers
- **Line 244-249**: Updated customer count queries to exclude inactive customers

**Before:**
```python
customers = Customer.query.filter(Customer.phone.isnot(None)).all()
total_customers = Customer.query.count()
customers_with_phones = Customer.query.filter(Customer.phone.isnot(None)).count()
```

**After:**
```python
customers = Customer.query.filter(
    Customer.phone.isnot(None),
    Customer.is_active == True
).all()
total_customers = Customer.query.filter(Customer.is_active == True).count()
customers_with_phones = Customer.query.filter(
    Customer.phone.isnot(None),
    Customer.is_active == True
).count()
```

#### Updated `customer_list()` function:
- **Line 267-271**: Modified to only return active customers for preview
- **Line 266**: Updated docstring to clarify active customers only

**Before:**
```python
customers = Customer.query.filter(Customer.phone.isnot(None)).all()
```

**After:**
```python
customers = Customer.query.filter(
    Customer.phone.isnot(None),
    Customer.is_active == True
).all()
```

### 2. Frontend Changes (`app/templates/bulk_message.html`)

#### Updated customer statistics display:
- **Line 64**: Changed "Total Customers" to "Active Customers"
- **Line 69**: Changed "With Phone Numbers" to "Active with Phone Numbers"
- **Line 17**: Updated main description to clarify "active customers"
- **Line 209**: Updated confirmation message to mention "active customers"
- **Line 425**: Updated error message for "active customers"

**Before:**
```html
<div class="text-sm text-gray-600">Total Customers</div>
<div class="text-sm text-gray-600">With Phone Numbers</div>
<p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">Send promotional messages and event announcements to all your customers</p>
```

**After:**
```html
<div class="text-sm text-gray-600">Active Customers</div>
<div class="text-sm text-gray-600">Active with Phone Numbers</div>
<p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">Send promotional messages and event announcements to all your active customers</p>
```

## Impact

### Customer Targeting
- ‚úÖ **Active Customers**: Included in bulk SMS campaigns

‚úÖ **Backend Logic**: Proper filtering implemented

### Example Output
