# Status Online Indicator - Feature Added

## Overview
Added a "Status Online" indicator with icon positioned next to the "Welcome back" message in the dashboard hero section to show that the user is currently online and the system is active.

## Features
- **Visual Indicator**: Green circle icon with pulsing animation
- **Animated Effects**: 
  - Pulsing green circle to indicate active status
  - Ping animation effect for enhanced visibility
- **Dashboard Integration**: Positioned in the hero header section below the welcome message
- **Themed Styling**: Matches the gradient background with semi-transparent styling

## Visual Elements
- **Icon**: Font Awesome circle icon (`fas fa-circle`)
- **Colors**: Green theme adapted for dark background (green-300, green-100, green-400/20)
- **Animations**: Custom CSS animations for pulse and ping effects
- **Layout**: Positioned below the "Welcome back" message in the dashboard hero section

## Implementation Details

### Dashboard Placement
- Located in the dashboard hero header section
- Positioned below the welcome message and subtitle
- Uses semi-transparent background with backdrop blur
- Styled to complement the gradient background

### Custom Styling
- Semi-transparent green background (`bg-green-400/20`)
- Border with transparency (`border-green-300/30`)
- Backdrop blur effect for modern glass-morphism look
- Light green text (`text-green-100`) for contrast against dark background

### Template Logic
- Only displays on the dashboard page
- Integrated into the hero section layout
- Uses existing CSS animations from base.html

## Files Modified
1. **`app/templates/base.html`**
   - Removed Status Online indicator from header navigation
   - Removed mobile menu version
   - Kept custom CSS animations for reuse

2. **`app/templates/dashboard.html`**
   - Added Status Online indicator in hero section
   - Positioned below welcome message
   - Styled for dark gradient background

## User Experience
- **Contextual Placement**: Appears where users naturally look when entering dashboard
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Positioned logically below welcome message
- **Professional Look**: Glass-morphism design that fits the hero section theme
- **Clear Status**: Prominent but not overwhelming visual confirmation

## Future Enhancements
Could be extended to show:
- Real connection status (online/offline detection)
- Last activity time
- Connection quality indicator
- Server status integration
